-------INSTALL-------

To install printruler, do the following:

qmake-qt4
make
make install

qmake-qt4 will generate a makefile from the .pro file.
make will compile the application, and make install will
install it. For the command make install, root privileges
may be needed. (sudo make install).

-------DEPENDENCIES-------

To compile printruler, you need at least Qt 4.3.
You will also need the developement libraries of Qt 4.3

Printruler need aditional applications to actualy run.
These are:
gs (ghostscript), ps2pdf, pdftops, psnup, psbook, psmerge and psselect, ps2ps

Printruler compiles fine without this applications installed, but they
are needed when running printruler.

Another nice to have dependency is cups-pdf, which then can be used
to directly print to printruler from any application.
You have to change in the preferences of printruler, the folder that
has to be watched for new files, to match the cups-pdf output folder.
